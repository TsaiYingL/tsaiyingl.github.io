                    In this project, I worked with my peers to explore and control remotely 
                    operated underwater vehicles. Our work included hands-on programming in Python 
                    and C++, processing sensor data, developing basic control algorithms, 
                    and executing mission-style tasks to understand how software, 
                    hardware, and hydrodynamics integrate to achieve reliable underwater 
                    operation.

                    During the course, we used Rasberry Pi 4B as out main computer.
                    We learned how to connect it with Visual Studio Code using SSH, 
                    assigning it to a static IP, and utilize it to run our AUV

                    The BlueROV2 is a modular, remotely operated underwater 
                    vehicle (ROV) developed by Blue Robotics, designed for 
                    accessible and versatile underwater exploration. In this 
                    course, we explored the BlueROV2’s mechanical structure, 
                    control architecture, and programming interface while 
                    learning the principles of buoyancy, propulsion, and 
                    underwater navigation.

                    To fully operate the BlueROV2, we incorporated concepts from linear algebra, 
                    calculus, and underwater physics to model and calculate the vehicle’s 
                    trajectory and motion dynamics. These principles allowed us to better 
                    understand how forces such as buoyancy, drag, and thrust influence the 
                    ROV’s movement, enabling more precise control and navigation during 
                    underwater operations. The mathematical concepts we studied were later 
                    implemented in our code using NumPy, allowing us to perform matrix 
                    calculations and simulate the physical behavior of the vehicle 
                    programmatically.
