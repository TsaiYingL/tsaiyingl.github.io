            About Me:
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm originally from New York city and has always been into embedded 
            systems and robotics. This curiosity led me to study computer enginnering, 
            where I can explore in both fields.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before transferring to Georgia Tech in Fall 2025, I studied at Stony Brook 
            University, where I was part of the WISE Honors Program and developed a 
            strong foundation in computer systems and programming. After transferring to
            Georigia Tech, I chose Distributed Systems & Software Design and 
            Robotics as my threads to futher strengthen my skills in both software and 
            hardware.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future, I hope to continue working on embedding systems and robotics, 
            whether in industry or research.
